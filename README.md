# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
### Description:
This challenge (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster) is posted on **Kaggle**.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

### Challenge
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). 

### Dataset
The data has been split into two groups:

* training set (train.csv)
* test set (test.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. 
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

**I achieved score of 0.86363 and rank 256.**
